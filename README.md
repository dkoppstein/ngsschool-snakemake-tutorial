# Setup

To setup a minimal snakemake environment, first install Miniconda with Bioconda channels by following the instructions [here](https://bioconda.github.io/user/install.html). 

Then, run 

```
conda create -n ngstutorial -c bioconda snakemake
```

# Exercises

Minimal examples corresponding to the slides can be found in the exercises folder. To run them, use:

snakemake -printshellcmds -- all
```

For dummy rules, run them using the `-n` flag. 

For rules with wrappers, use `--use-conda`.
